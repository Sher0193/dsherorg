# dsher.org

This is the implementation of my first personal website, a static PHP webpage to serve as a convenient link for my GitHub and Resume. This is a very basic LAMP stack website, tested in XAMPP and deployed on Apache Web Server.

## Testing

1. Download the right version of XAMPP for your Operating System: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

2. Open the XAMPP Control Panel.

3. Start Apache Web Server.

4. Copy all files from this repository to the 'htdocs' folder under the XAMPP install folder. On Windows, this is found at C:\xampp\htdocs

5. View the website by typing "localhost" in your web browser.


## Deployment

The live version of dsher.org is deployed on a Debian 10 system following these Apache specifications: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-apache-web-server-on-debian-10
